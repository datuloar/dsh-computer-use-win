description: >-
  Windows computer use: read windows as text (control tree, OCR), click
  controls by name, type, scroll, drag and take screenshots, with an on-screen
  indicator the human can see and stop with ESC. Use it when the answer is not
  in the files, the shell or the tests — a GUI or a browser page must be read
  or driven, a UI change verified, or window focus and permissions are in
  question.

# dsh-computer-use

## When to use

Use it when the answer is not in the files, the shell or the tests: an app, a browser page or a
dialog must be read or driven, or a UI change must be verified. Do not use it when reading files,
running builds or tests can answer the question.

## Tools or commands

If the harness lists tools named `mcp__pc__ui_tree`, `mcp__pc__tap`, `mcp__pc__click` and so on, use
them: they are the same commands served by `dsh-cu mcp`, answer in tens of milliseconds and start the
indicator on the first input by themselves. Otherwise call the `dsh-cu` commands below from the
shell. Everything in this skill applies to both.

## The loop — text first, pixels last

1. `dsh-cu overlay` — the human gets an 8 s countdown and ESC cancels. Every input command refuses
   to run until the indicator is up, and refuses again the moment it dies.
2. `dsh-cu focus --title "part of the title"` (or `focus <pid>`) the target window.
3. Read it as text, cheapest first:
   - `dsh-cu tree` — roles, names and a clickable point per control. Works for most native apps and
     for Chrome/Edge pages (the first call wakes the browser's accessibility tree, ~1 s).
   - `dsh-cu find "save"` — only the controls whose name contains the text.
   - `dsh-cu read --region x y w h` — Windows OCR when the window has no tree (games, canvases,
     remote desktops). Each line comes with the point to click. Add `--lang en-US` or `--lang ru`
     to match the UI language.
   - `dsh-cu shot --region x y w h` — only when the question is about pixels (colour, layout, an
     image). Crop it; a full screen is thousands of tokens.
4. Act: `dsh-cu tap "Save"` clicks the one control with that name and refuses when the name is
   ambiguous or the control is covered. Otherwise `click x y` on a point taken from step 3.
5. Verify with the same cheap reader (`tree`, `find`, `read`). A step is done only when the new
   state says so.
6. `dsh-cu overlay --stop` when finished.

Coordinates everywhere are physical screen pixels: what `tree`, `find` and `read` print is exactly
what `click`, `move` and `drag` expect.

Keep every answer small: the harness trims tool output past ~4 KB from the middle. `tree` stops at
120 controls and says so; when it does, ask `find "<word>"` or lower `--depth` instead of reading
the whole window again. `read` a region, not the screen.

## Browser pages

Chromium browsers expose links, buttons and fields through the same tree: `dsh-cu tree --title
Chrome --depth 12`, then `tap "Sign in"`. Navigate with the keyboard, which never misses:
`dsh-cu keys ctrl+l`, `dsh-cu type "https://example.com"`, `dsh-cu key Enter`. If the harness also
has a browser MCP (Playwright), prefer it for heavy web work — it reads the DOM directly.

## Typing, scrolling, dragging

- `type` sends a newline as Enter and a tab as Tab, and checks the indicator between chunks, so the
  human's ESC stops a long text within seconds.
- The wheel goes to the window under the pointer: `dsh-cu wheel -600 1280 700` is five notches
  down at that point. Scrolling moves every coordinate — read again before the next click.
- `dsh-cu drag 420 300 980 300` for sliders, selections and drag-and-drop.
- `click ... middle` opens a link in a new tab, `click ... triple` selects a line.

## What the human sees

- a rounded panel at the top: "DeepSeek is controlling your computer", the command that is
  running ("click Save"), and an `ESC` chip; amber with a countdown ring while announcing;
- a soft blue glow along the screen edge;
- a ring around their own pointer, which pulses where you click. Their cursor stays the only
  pointer. With `--hide-cursor` the system cursor is blanked and a drawn arrow replaces it (for
  screen sharing), still exactly one pointer.

Typed text is shown as a character count, never as the text. The ring is a window, so it appears
in your screenshots and marks where the pointer is; `--quiet` hides the panel and the glow.

## Safety

- Never press anything destructive without an explicit request: deletion, installs, purchases,
  sending messages, closing other people's windows, banking or UAC dialogs.
- One step at a time against a fresh read of the screen; never a blind click series.
- Never type secrets unless asked directly. `clipboard get` can expose whatever the human last
  copied — read it only when the task needs it.
- `dsh-cu run` and `dsh-cu broker start` are for windows this process cannot reach (UIPI); use them
  only on an explicit request, never as a shortcut for shell work.
- Elevated windows and the secure desktop (UAC, lock screen) are unreachable — say so instead of
  fighting it.
- `overlay --stop` is not optional. If a pointer was hidden with `--hide-cursor` and the indicator
  died, the next `dsh-cu` command restores it and says so.

## Limits

- Windows only, primary monitor, physical pixels.
- The tree is UI Automation, not the DOM; some custom-drawn UIs expose nothing — use `read`.
- OCR misreads small or low-contrast text; prefer `tree`/`tap` wherever a tree exists.
- A minimised window has no controls on screen: `focus` it first.
